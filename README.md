## ToDo

There is still a lot of work to be done.

A few ideas are:

- Color and stroke palette
- Saving with author name and doodle name
- Load view filtering
- Loading by id parameter (in url)
- Geometric palette (rectangles, circles etc)
- User Authentication (User system for saving private doodles for example)

Feel free to submit your own ideas with a Pull Request!
